The strike mandate does not actually declare astrike; rather, it gives the union “the mandate (or right) to declare a strike when strategicallynecessary.”CUPE 3902 and U of T have been in negotiations over the next collective agreement sinceNovember. The union represents over 8,000 workers, including teaching assistants, courseinstructors, tutors, markers, exam invigilators, and chief presiding officers, who have been employedby the university during the past 12 months. A university spokesperson wrote to The Varsity prior to the strike vote that they “recognize theimportant role of employees in the CUPE 3902 Unit 1 bargaining unit in ensuring that the Universityof Toronto continues to be the leading academic institution in Canada. The University also respectsthe Union’s process, including the decision to hold a strike vote, which is not an unusual step in thecollective bargaining process.”Demands from CUPE 3902“U of T has not yet meaningfully addressed the union’s high priority issues including hiring andpandemic−related working conditions,” wrote Amy Conwell, Chair of CUPE 3902, in a press releasefollowing the vote.Some demands set out by CUPE 3902 at the beginning of its bargaining include clear parameters ofjob duties, more hours of work provided for remote or hybrid work, and paid equity training on avariety of topics. The union is also asking for increased wages, benefits, and paid sick days. In an interview with The Varsity, Conwell emphasized the importance of this bargaining process.“Our demands are going to increase the quality and experience of undergraduate education at theuniversity,” she said. “We’re a large group of workers who have the ability to impact undergraduateeducation in a really huge way.”Continuation of bargainingFollowing the strong strike mandate vote, Conwell expressed that the bargaining team “wouldexpect any employer to immediately start making some movement at the bargaining table.”According to Conwell, the union was “surprised that that didn’t actually happen.” Although theunion’s first course of action is still to “amicably” resolve issues, the unit is ready for collective action1 should U of T not respond adequately to the unit’s demands. According to Conwell, the university has expressed that the pandemic is “not a reason to bargainlongstanding changes to a collective agreement that will hold for years to come.” Conwell argued,however, that since the pandemic will likely not end soon, “it’s actually really important andnecessary to consider this particular circumstance in bargaining.”CUPE 3902 continues to be in negotiations with the university until the two parties reach a tentativeagreement and ratify it",https://thevarsity.ca/2021/02/28/cupe-3902-members-vote-strongly-in-favour-of-strike-mandate/
