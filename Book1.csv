Nurses at the Victorian Order of Nurses (VON) in Sarnia, Ont. are now on strike.The team of 24 nurses walked off the job at 8 a.m. Saturday morning after their contract demandswere not met by their employer.""We're asking for 1%, it works out to about $.22 cents an hour,"" says Deborah Kostiw, a registeredpractical nurse (RPN) with VON.The VON RPN's who care for high?needs patients in both homes and schools have been without acontract since 2019.""The employer made a couple offers one of them requiring concessions, significant concessionsand forcing them to lose their autonomy here,"" says Ken Sharpe, director of field operations forLiuna Local 3000.""Even though VON can give them one per cent total compensation, they're choosing not to. Notbecause they can't, not because they can't afford it, not because they don't want to simply becausethey don't want to set the precedent going forward for negotiations in the rest of the province"".Sharpe says VON offered a zero wage increase in year one, and 1 per cent in year two, but no dailyovertime and no increase in mileage rates.""VON has refused negotiations with their union to provide them all with paid sick leave, healthbenefits, bereavement leave, fair overtime compensation, or a reasonable wage increase,"" saysSharpe.""Currently we're covered under Bill 124, which prohibits the employer from giving any more thanone per cent total compensation. What we're asking for one per cent in each year of the contract.VON has come back and offered them what is essentially for a full time nurse $218. That is lessthan $5 a week to do the work that they do every day in the middle of a global pandemic"".CTV News has reached out to the employer and a statement was issued.""This is a challenging time for everyone. We are working closely with our community partners oncontingency plans to limit any potential impact on our clients and their families. VON employees areat the heart of everything we do. We value and respect their work and have a strong commitment tofairness. VON is fully committed to the bargaining process, and to continuing to work toward aresolution,"" a VON spokesperson said in the statement.1
In Sarnia there are two categories of nurses, Visiting nurses and Shift nurses. The shift nursesspend a lot of time in schools taking are of vulnerable children while visiting nurses are in thecommunity seeing people in their homes.""We may be the only people that they see a week,"" says Kostiw.""We are their connection to the world. We come in here for them we care for them like they're ourown. But that means that we are compromised. It means that our safety is at risk but that's our joband we do it, but we should be paid fairly for that"".The team of 24 local nurses and Union representatives will take turns picketing in front of the VONoffice on London Line in Sarnia wearing masks and physically distancing until a new deal isreached.""What we're going to do is we're going to keep it very small and respectful,"" says Sharpe.""We want to be respectful of the businesses around here, respectful of the fact that we're in themiddle of a global pandemic. You can see everyone's wearing the appropriate PPE and sociallydistancing"".Sharpe adds that they want the strike to end quickly, but with a fair deal.""The nurses are putting their lives on the line every single day they go to work,"" says Sharpe","Nurses walk off the job in Sarnia, Ont and are now on strikeCTV News LondonBrent LalePublished Saturday, May 1, 2021",https://london.ctvnews.ca/nurses-walk-off-the-job-in-sarnia-ont-and-are-now-on-strike-1.5410238
05/01/2021,VON nurses in Sarnia set to go on strike Saturday (SarniaObserver),"About 23 registered practical nurses working for Victorian Order of Nurses (VON) in Sarnia are setto go on strike Saturday morning if a new deal isn't reached.Ken Sharpe, business representative with LiUNA Local 3000, said the union notified the employerlast Friday the workers would strike if there wasn't a new deal in place by 8 a.m. Saturday.The nurses, who care for medically fragile students in schools and for patients at home, have beenwithout a contract since their previous collective agreement lapsed in April 2019, he said.Sharpe said going on strike is the last thing the union and the nurses want to do.""They became nurses because they care about people,"" he said. ""They're not asking for the starsand noon. They're asking for a fair deal. They're asking the employer to recognize them as thehealthcare heroes they keep telling them they are.""Sharpe said the employer offered a 0.5 per cent lump sum payment to the nurses for 2019, whichwould be $218, at most, for a full?time nurse, instead of a wage increase.He said legislation allows one per cent annual increases in compensation.""VON has chosen not to do that,"" Sharpe said. ""Not because they can't. Not because they don'thave the money ? because they don't want to set the precedent.""Sharpe said the VON nurses currently earn about $9 an hour less in base wages than registeredpractical nurses working in county?owned long?term care, between $2 and $4 less than thoseworking in other general long?term care settings and between $8 and $10 less than those workingin hospitals.""All the emails that we get from upper management always start with 'Dear valued employee,'"" saidunion member Brittany Glazer. ""I'm sorry, but what they've offered us, and what they're trying to doto us, is not showing that we're valued, at all.""Some of the nurses are classed as casual employees, ""which prevents them from having access tosick time, bereavement leave, benefits,"" and some aren't paid overtime, Sharpe said.""Some of these nurses go into the school system to see vulnerable children and have no sick timewhatsoever,"" although they have been at risk of contracting COVID?19 in that setting, he said.3
The same is true for the visiting nurses going into the homes of patients, Sharpe said.""They put themselves in harm's way every single day,"" he said.Sharpe said Friday he reached out to VON ""and indicated my desire to continue to bargain, but thatwe want a fair deal.""VON said in a statement it is ""fully committed to the bargaining process and hopes for timelyresolution of the matter.""The statement added, ""We are working closely with our community partners on contingency plans tolimit any potential impact on our clients and their families."" pmorden@postmedia.com",IDNUMBER P4iYfA1cOl8hEBm1fuvMTZSihGM PUBLICATION:Sarnia Observer SOURCE:Sarnia Observer PAGE:A2DATE:20210501 SECTION:News BYLINE:Paul Morden,
05/01/2021,Ornge air ambulance paramedics vote in favour of strike overone per cent wage law (The Canadian Press),"The union that represents Ontario's air ambulance paramedics says its members are prepared to goon strike if they can't land an exemption from a provincial law capping salaries for public employees.Unifor said Sunday that Ornge paramedics voted 94 per cent in favour of strike action, butdescribed the move as an “absolute last consideration.”Unifor National President Jerry Dias called the wage?cap law dubbed Bill 124 a “foolish piece oflegislation” in a virtual press conference.The Bill came into effect in 2019 and caps public sector wage increases to one per cent a year,which Dias said is “well below even the rate of inflation.”Paramedics who work for Ornge have been without a contract since July 31.Ornge says union members rejected a recent tentative agreement that complied with Bill 124.Ornge paramedics have been instrumental in helping transfer critically ill COVID?19 patients tointensive care units across the province. They also helped implement Ontario's vaccination plan inremote communities.Mark Etherington, a critical care flight paramedic who joined Dias at the press conference, said he'sworried about the emotional toll the pandemic is having on Ornge workers.He said the mental health issues and post?traumatic stress that's “about to emerge in this finalwave of the pandemic is real.”Union members voted on whether or not to strike on Friday. If they do choose to strike, they wouldfirst have to give notice.Dias said the Ornge paramedics understand their responsibility during the COVID?19 crisis, addinggoing on strike is “the last thing in the world that anybody wants to do.”A spokesman for the medical transportation service says he believes both parties will be able tocome to an agreement.Spokespeople for the provincial government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Ornge air ambulance paramedics vote in favour of strike over one per cent wage lawThe Canadian PressPublished Sunday, May 2, 2021",https://www.cp24.com/news/ornge-air-ambulance-paramedics-vote-in-favour-of-strike-over-one-per-cent-wage-law-1.5410815
